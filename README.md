It is the r programming language for the DATA_MANIPULATION_and_EDA using diamond dataset
Explanation:
Your code demonstrates various data manipulation and visualization techniques using the `diamonds` dataset from `ggplot2`. Here's a brief overview of what each section does:
1. **Loading Libraries:**
   - You load necessary libraries like `dplyr`, `lattice`, `MASS`, and `ggplot2` for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Filtering and Viewing Data:**
   - You create a subset of the `diamonds` dataset where the `carat` is greater than 2 and `price` is greater than 10,000. You then display the first few rows of this subset.
   - You add a new column `price_per_carat` to the `diamonds` dataset, which is calculated by dividing the `price` by the `carat`.
   - You filter the dataset to find diamonds with `price` greater than 18,000 and 18,810, as well as the diamond with the maximum `price`.

3. **Selecting and Mutating Data:**
   - You select specific columns (`carat`, `cut`, `price`) from the `diamonds` dataset and display them.
   - You add a new column `grade` based on the value of `carat`, assigning "A" if `carat` is less than 0.7 and "B" otherwise.

4. **Arranging and Grouping Data:**
   - You sort the `diamonds` dataset by `carat` in descending order.
   - You group the dataset by `carat` and calculate a new column `price_carat`.

5. **Summarizing Data:**
   - You summarize the `diamonds` dataset to calculate the mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of `price`.
   - You group the dataset by `cut` and calculate the average `price` for each `cut`.

6. **Visualizations:**
   - **Scatter Plot:** You create a scatter plot of `carat` vs. `price`.
   - **Histogram:** You create a histogram showing the distribution of `price` across different `cut` categories.
